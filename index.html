									ABW is a concept to design your office in such a way that it supports work activities optimally, rather than drawing a boundary around a users' personal spaces, i.e. when everyone sits at a uniform desk with all their gear in one place. Users can concentrate better, be more productive, attract and retain talent, be more active and mindful, and enjoy their work more.</p>
